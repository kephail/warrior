Following a great first night of the year, we have some more talks!

Todd Perry, professional zoomer and placement student will kick off the night, then we have graduate Tom Savage coming all the way down from old London town.

As of before, we'll be at the [Brewhouse & Kitchen](http://brewhouseandkitchen.com/) for some half-time beverages.
