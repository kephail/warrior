It's finally here, the FIRST COMPUTING SOCIAL OF 2015!!!!!!

The theme is game characters, we are expecting you all to dress up! For example: Mario, Luigi, Lara Croft, COD, Pacman, Assassins Creed, Zelda, Sonic, Crash Bandicoot, Spyro.

We'll be meeting at the Union, Meeting room 3 at 9:30pm for the Emergency General Meeting (EGM), and starting the night at 20:00pm from there onwards.
Yes this means we'll be running the meeting in fancy dress.

We'll soon be posting the other locations/times in case you can't meet us at the beginning.

Can't wait to see you all there!!
