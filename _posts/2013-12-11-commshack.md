Come for a day of hacking, learning and fun. The theme is communication and we will be introducing people to making apps with SMS and voice features powered on the web!

There will be free food so you can graze throughout the event. Also mysterious swag!

Driven by Twilio, you could make something which texts you when your dinner is cooked. Or a wake-up call with your day's to-do list spoken to you by Microsoft Sam!

Anyone is welcome (that's non-students too!), whether your skills lie in graphic design or web development. The main goal is to make some interesting stuff!

Donâ€™t worry if you have no programming knowledge, you should be able to find someone who you can hack with.
