Halloween will have come and gone, what memories! You took so many pictures that night, all safely stored on your trusty USB stick!

But wait... Oh dear. You didn't safely eject it. They're all lost, you don't even remember the night without the images.

Then you best come on the _Corrupted Pub Crawl_.
