It's our first talk night of the year and we have some interesting talks to be excited for! We've moved from the classrooms of last year and trying out a new venue.

Hosted at the [Brewhouse & Kitchen](http://brewhouseandkitchen.com/), there's going to be a great atmosphere. Plus the benefit of convenient refreshments through-out!

Come and enjoy the following:
